<Layout title="About Us">
  <h1>Who Am I? ðŸ‘‹</h1>
  <p>
    Iâ€™m a web developer passionate about turning everyday ideas into
    interactive, creative projects.<br /> Whether itâ€™s gamifying productivity, generating
    playlists based on mood, or making study groups more engaging, I love building
    tools that are both useful and fun.
